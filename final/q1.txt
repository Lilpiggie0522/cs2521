Question 1

(a) What is the maximum input size that can be processed? Justify your
    answer.

2^10 = 1 day

fast = 2^10 * 1000 = 1 day
log2(2^10 * 1000) = 19.96


(b) Which of the two algorithms is more efficient? Justify your answer.
binary more efficient cuz size from n to n / 16 takes 6 comparions, however, binary takes 
4 comparions which is n/2/2/2/2.


(c) What are the time complexities of fnA() and fnB() in terms of a and
    b? Justify your answer.

time complexities of fnA() is b - a, since smallest a is 0, and it runs from 1 to b, therefore, it will be b - a times recursive function calls
time complexities of fnB() is (b - a) * (b - a)
