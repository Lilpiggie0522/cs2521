Question 4

Which of the given algorithms could have been used to construct the
mininum spanning tree? Justify your answer.

only kruskal, cuz DFS does not even construct mst, dijkstra goes to each node and relaxes along the adjacent edges to find shortest path, which in this case, is looking for mst.
Prim has to choose cheapest edges which one node is visited and another node is not, in this case, the edge picking is not consistent, therefore not possible. Only kruskal has
this kidna behaviour.
