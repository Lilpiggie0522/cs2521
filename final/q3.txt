Question 3

(a) Which of the given sequences (A, B, C or D) would be produced by a
    valid post-order traversal of the same tree? Explain your answer.

pre-order: 16, 10, 7, 2, 8, 14, 24, 20, 40, 33
                                                          16
                                                    10           24
                                                   7 14       20    40
                                                  2 8              33

when post order traverses into a node, it first goes left, right, then prints itself, therefore, 2 then 8 then 7, then 14 then 10 gives B

(b)

Value in the root node: 36

Value in the left child (of the root): 32

Value in the right child (of the root): 39

(c) Give the rotations that are performed (if any) as a result of
    inserting each value.

xx Wrong
inserting 25 results in shift left at node 5, then inserting 8 results in shifting right at 19. 

correct answer: inserting 25 gives left rotation at 22. inserting 5 gives right rotation at 13, then left rotation at 5
