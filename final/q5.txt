Question 5

(a) Describe and justify the steps you would take to determine which
    sorting algorithm the program uses.

Selection sort has a worst case time complexity of O(n^2), where as median of 3 is nlog(n),
therefore, running the executable with input size of 10000 and then double the input size to 20000,
selection sort will take roughly 4 times longer, and selection will roughly a bit more than double.

(b) Is the sorting algorithm that the program uses stable? How confident
    are you in your conclusion? Explain your answer.

yes, stable, (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 7) were the original order, and this order was reserved after sorting, same goes for other pairs.
But this does not gurantee that it is stable. An unstable algorithm might provided this outcome sometimes.
